  <description>
A small mod that allows gravship launch sites to expire after a time, preventing them from cluttering the map forever.

By default functions in the same way as abandoned camps, only removing sites that aren't located on a landmark. This can be configured, as well as the number of days launch sites persist for.
*Settings do not apply retroactively to old launch sites!

Performance
- Patches a single function that only runs when a settlement is abandoned. Should have no meaningful impact.

Adding to saves
- Safe
- Pre-existing launch sites will not despawn

Removing from saves
- Probably safe?
- Landmark launch sites will disappear with a one-time red error. Remove them in dev mode first if you want to be safe.</description>
